## Random Facts  
- **6,000 cyberattacks per day target Microsoft systems**, showing the immense scale of modern cyber threats.

## Key Concepts  

### Networking  
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**  
  Maps private IP addresses to a single public IP, enabling devices within a private network to communicate with the internet.  
  *(It’s like a translator between your local network and the internet.)*  

- **Bridge**  
  Connects two or more networks, allowing them to function as one and enabling devices in separate networks to communicate.  

---

### Cybersecurity Concepts  
- **Zero-Day**  
  A vulnerability unknown to the software vendor, exploited by attackers before a patch is available.  

- **Exploit**  
  A tool or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or control.  

- **Vulnerability**  
  A weakness or flaw in a system, application, or network that can be exploited by hackers.  

- **Doxing**  
  The act of collecting and publishing personal information about someone, typically to harass or harm them.  

- **Hack Value**  
  The perceived worth or importance of hacking a particular system, often tied to the challenge or prestige.  

- **Payload**  
  The malicious code or action delivered through an exploit, such as stealing data, corrupting systems, or installing malware.  

- **Daisy Chaining**  
  Using one compromised system to attack and access other systems within a network.  

- **Information Security**  
  Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.  

- **CIA Triangle**  
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensures data is accessible only to authorized individuals.  
  - **Integrity**: Maintains the accuracy and trustworthiness of data.  
  - **Availability**: Ensures data and systems are accessible when needed.  

- **FCU Triangle**  
  Balances:  
  - **Functionality**: How well a system performs its intended purpose.  
  - **Usability**: How easy the system is to use.  
  - **Cost**: The expense of maintaining security and functionality.  

- **Data Nonrepudiation**  
  Ensures that the origin and delivery of data cannot be denied, typically using digital signatures or logging.  

- **Authenticity**  
  Verifies the legitimacy of users, data, or systems to prevent impersonation or tampering.  

- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**  
  A long-term, targeted attack by a skilled and organized group, often focused on valuable systems or data.  

---

### Malware Types  
- **Stuxnet**  
  A sophisticated worm targeting industrial control systems, such as nuclear plants, to disrupt their operation.  

- **Trojan**  
  Malware disguised as legitimate software to trick users into installing it.  

- **Worm**  
  A self-replicating program that spreads through networks without user interaction.  

- **Shrink-Wrap Attack**  
  Exploiting default settings or configurations in software that users fail to change.  

- **Malware**  
  Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized control of systems or data.

## Steps to Hack  

1. **Reconnaissance**  
   - **Passive**: Collecting publicly available information about the target (e.g., searching Google or social media).  
   - **Active**: Interacting with the target to gather more detailed information (e.g., scanning for open ports).  

2. **Scanning**  
   Identifying active devices, open ports, and vulnerabilities in the target system.  

3. **Enumeration**  
   Extracting information such as usernames, shared resources, and system details.  

4. **System Hacking**  
   - **Exploitation**: Gaining unauthorized control over a system.  
   - **Maintaining Access**: Using tools like rootkits, Trojans, or backdoors to keep control of the system.  
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Elevating access from a regular user to an administrator or root-level user.  

5. **Maintaining Access**  
   - **Rootkits**: Software that conceals the presence of malware or backdoors.  
   - **Backdoors**: Tools or methods to regain access after exploitation.  

6. **Clearing Tracks**  
   Removing evidence of an attack to avoid detection by system administrators.
